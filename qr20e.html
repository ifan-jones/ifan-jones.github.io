	<p>This was Elin Hughes’ shop in the early years and after that Evan Wynne and Morfudd Owen ran it as did Ceridwen Roberts for many years. Evan Wynne used to carry goods to Nant Gwrtheyrn with a horse and sleigh belonging to William Thomas, Tŷ Canol, Nant. In 1995, the postmistress and owner of Siop Pen-y-groes decided to wind up the business. A public meeting was called, and the decision was made to fundraise locally to buy the shop. Cwmni Cydweithredol Menter yr Eifl was established in 1996.  <p>
