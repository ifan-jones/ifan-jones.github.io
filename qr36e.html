	<p>Captain Richard Griffith was a tough man, and a quarryman in Trefor. One day, he left his lunchbox on the wall, decided to go to sea, walking to Porthmadog instead of Trefor. After a while, he returned on shore leave, when he taught children to swim, pushing them off Wern landing stage and jumping in after them to hold their heads above water. He saved every penny, and with those savings, he built a terrace of new houses at the far end of the village, ensuring they had a proper supply of water.<p>
<br><p>Captain Richard Griffith lived on the outskirts of the village in Ty’n y Garreg. He was a hard, rough man, and worked in the quarry in Trefor. One morning, on his way to work, he decided to go to sea, and so he left his lunchbox at the bottom of the hill and headed for Porthmadog.</p>

<br><p>Once there, he boarded a sailing vessel bound for Cardiff. He managed to pass his examinations and worked his way up to be a well-respected Captain. He was very careful with money and didn’t swear or drink. After a stint at sea, he came home, and during shore leave, he would teach the lads in the village to swim. He took them to Wern Landing Stage, pushed them into the water and jumped in after them, holding their heads above water. With his savings, the Captain managed to build a row of new houses in the far end of the village, and they were supplied with water. During the Second World War the Japanese were cruel to the Captain. He was a thrown into a hole in the ground, standing up and was repeatedly kicked in the head. For his bravery at sea, he received an OBE. He is buried in Colwyn Bay, where he died.</p></p>
