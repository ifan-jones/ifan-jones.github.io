The chapel was built for £189, seating 300 people. After building the first chapel, a gale ripped the roof off, which was found whole in a nearby field. A preaching meeting was held in November 1881 to establish and officially open the chapel, naming it Moreia. The chapel closed on 25 March 1997.<p>

<br><p>In 1932, the vestry was built, and the land was given by Evan Jones and E. Edwards, Llithfaen Isaf.</p>
<br><p>In  1943, the Reverend Arthur Thomas was ordained as Moreia’s minister and he was the Minister for Salem, y Ffôr also. He remained in Moreia until 1948.</p>
<br><p>Here’s a few recollections from Ellen Evans, Alpha:</p>
<p>“They worked hard to get the denomination going in the village. It all started in an old  barn, and after building the first chapel , the roof got blown off in a severe gale, and it was found intact in a nearby field. The minister cried openly because of this, but the chapel’s fortuned turned around soon enough.” </p>
