<h2>Aros Ennyd</h2>

<p>If you look carefully, you can see the remains of a hut near the stone wall. These are the
remains of Cwt Aidan (Aidan’s Shelter) or &#39;Aros Ennyd&#39; (Stay a While). The walls are set in a T-
shape to have shelter from the wind from any direction. Edward Aidan Davies worked in the
main quarry (Gwaith Mawr) and travelled from his home in Llithfaen, along Lȏn Gwaith (the
Quarry Path) and down to the quarry. One can imagine that the journey was quite unpleasant
in bad weather, and therefore, Aros Ennyd was a comfortable place to take a short break,
before facing the rest of the journey. Edward Aidan Davies lived in Tŷ Croes, Llithfaen and was
born in 1871. He married Catherine and they had two sons, Elwy and Eifion. He was a sets
maker in the quarry. As a rule, the majority of sets makers would sit on a cushion placed on a
block of stone, with another block of solid wood in front of him so that he could place the stone
on it to turn it around and work it as needed. They would use a patter hammer (morthwyl
patro). The word ‘patro’ undoubtedly comes from the English word patter, meaning rapidity -
morthwyl patro means therefore, a hammer to strike rapidly, which creates a sound quite
similar to hailstones against a window. This was the fastest moving of all the hammers. The
most skilled sets maker would patter on his feet, this method was much tougher on the body.
The person would stand over the stone and bend down to work. A standing sets maker would
produce more sets than a sitting sets maker. His hammer weighed two pounds more - seven
pounds compared to five pounds. Furthermore, the handle of his hammer was also longer. A
standing sets maker would have more the wear and tear on the front of the shoe, as he would
use his feet to manipulate the stone all day. He would use a &#39;Clem Fawr’, a large steel clamp
over the front of the shoe manipulating the stone. That said, the Clem Fawr wouldn&#39;t last very
long if you were a good worker.</p>
<p>Edward Aidan Davies was active in the chapel and his community. This is a hymn written by him
from his work in &quot;Caniedydd yr Annibinnnwyr&quot; (The Independent Hymnbook)</p>
<br>
<p>Arglwydd, rho dy wen yn helaeth,<br>
Wrth ymadael o’r gwasanaeth;<br>
Gad im ddychwel mewn llawenydd<br>
Adref, gyda bendith newydd.<br>
Os pechasom yn dy erbyn<br>
Drwy I bethau’r byd ein dil<yn,<br>
Maddau inni ein crwydriadau,<br>
A sancteiddia ein serchiadau.<br>
Arwain ni i’n cartrefleoedd<br>
Arwain o dan wlith y nefoedd;<br>
Sŵn awelon pen Calfaria<br>
Fyddo’n aros wedi’r oedfa.<br></p>
<p>He was a country poet, and would win on competitions in local Eisteddfodau, such as
commemorative verses odes (penillion). He won several competitions for composing hymn
words. He would write verses to mark the occasional important event. In 1905, he won for
writing a Pryddest titled “Yr Iesu’n golchi traed y disgyblion” (&quot;Jesus washes the disciples&#39; feet&quot;).
His work would be recited a lot at competitions in Eisteddfodau in Welsh communities in
England and beyond, such as Manchester.</p>
