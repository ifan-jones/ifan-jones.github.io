	<h2 class="major">Post Office</h2>
	<p>Liverpool House was Llithfaen’s Post Office, ran by William Evans, according to the 1881 census, and by the turn of the century, his son in law, W.H. Roberts, ran the Post. He would also carry goods to Nant Gwrtheyrn. Later, Mrs Dinah Owen kept an eye on things for several years. The last family to run a shop here were the Jordans. The lads in the village used to socialise and gather here. After closing as a shop, the building was bought by Ymddiriedolaeth Nant Gwrtheyrn as an office.</p>

<br><span class="image right"><img src="qr/images/qr21a.jpg" alt="Hen Bost" />W H Roberts, the postmaster by the door of the Post circa 1910.</span>
<p>Dewi Williams, Brynmor, remembers  Alun Roberts, Post, converting his lorry into a bus to carry people back and forth to Pwllheli. W.H. Roberts was postmaster around 1910 (he was Alun Roberts’ father). They used to carry goods to Nant Gwrtheyrn in a small truck. Alun Roberts ran the bus to Pwllheli between 1915-20. </p>
<br><p>W.H. Roberts was a very learned man. There’s a record in ‘Yr Herald Gymraeg’ in 2 January 1914, that he gave an illustrated lecture with Robert John, Bryn Meirion, entitled ‘Eighty years of  Victoria’s reign.’ He also conducted the village’s children choir, it had 45 members.</p>
<br><p>Ellen Evans, Alpha remembers:</p>
<br><p>Before long, three shops were established in the village, and one of them sold everything imaginable. Goods were taken into the shop by cart, from the ‘Rebecca Mary’, a ship from Pwllheli. This ship bought the goods to Pwllheli from Liverpool. The cart came to the shop every Tuesday, and the ‘Herald Cymraeg’ came on the cart from Pwllheli. One lady came from shop with the Herald, and hurried around, going about her business, until one of her neiighbours stopped her, asking ‘What have you got there?’ ‘Yr Herald’ she said. ‘Oh!’ he said, ‘the shopkeeper was busy all afternoon reading it before you.’ She then turned, and went back into the shop, slammed the paper on the counter and demanded that she wanted her money back, because that he had read her paper. It was here that the postman set up shop, and delivered mail to the villagers, after coming from Pwllheli with a pony and trap.</p>
<br><p>The last people to run the Post in Liverpool House, was Mrs Owen and her daughter.  After the shop closed, the building was bought by Ymddiriedolaeth Nant Gwrtheyrn, and they used it as an office. </p>
