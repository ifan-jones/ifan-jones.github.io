<h2>Carnguwch</h2>
<p>Look towards the sea, to the right. You&#39;ll see St Tudwal Islands – two islands south of Abersoch
known as Tudwal Fawr (St. Tudwal West) and Tudwal Fach Island (St. Tudwal East). Tudwal
Fawr was bought by the adventurer Bear Grylls in 2009. Tudwal Fawr is home to the light
beacon. The light beacon was built in 1877 and it was turned into an unmanned light beacon in
1935. Tudwal Fach was owned by author Romana Barrack (Carla Lane), co-author of The Liver
Birds (1969-79) author of Butterflies (1978-83) and Bread (1986-91) until her death in 2016. The
island was purchased by her in 1991 to protect wildlife and for the creation of an animal
sanctuary.</p>
<p>Tudwal was a Briton who emigrated to Brittany in the sixth century and whilst there, he was
consecrated bishop. In Tudwal&#39;s time, the sea was a vital link to civilisation, as they moved from
island to island, from peninsula to peninsula looking for suitable places to meditate and retreat
to.</p>
<p>Henry Bailey Maria Hughes was brought up in Rhoscolyn and is remembered as a serious,
godly boy. His hair was white from childhood. He was short-sighted and was often roaming the
fields in prayer. He was accepted into the Catholic faith and could preach in many languages.
he was an interpreter/translator for the Council of the Vatican in Rome and he spread the word
about Catholicism throughout Africa, Portugal, Canada and America. He then came to St
Tudwal&#39;s Island. He was the last to be on the island to attempt to continue the work that St
Tudwal had begun a thousand years before. He got many to come there to assist in establishing
a monastery, but all his attempts failed. Their boat started leaking and the collection money was
scarce (3/d). His monastery on the island was destroyed on the Eve of All Saints just before
Christmas 1887.</p>
<p>St Tudwals&#39;s is a rough place during a storm, and it was in this strait that Huw Puw&#39;s flat
bottomed boat sailed into trouble and foundered. Hugh Pugh hailed from Liverpool and was
captain and co-owner of the wooden flat Ann. Ann was built at Frodsham in 1799. Flat is the
name of a flat bottom hull ship, ideal for the shallow water. Ann sailed the River Mersey, River
Dee and River Conwy. Usually, she sailed between Caernarfon, y Felinheli (Porthdinorwic)
Liverpool and Runcorn carrying coal, timber, or slate. She was a 60-ton boat with one mast and
a crew of three. Ann, under Hugh Pugh&#39;s command, was sailing, with a cargo of timber from
Menai Bridge to Barmouth when a storm hit St. Tudwal&#39;s Road on 18 October 1858. The Ann
was wrecked and all the crew were saved. Rumour has it that Hugh Pugh&#39;s wife was
accompanying him onboard, which was considered a bad omen amongst sailors. There are
various amusing stories about Hugh Pugh during his time at sea. He was a witty character who
enjoyed socialising, a good story and a few pints! Hugh Pugh died in 1865 aged 70 and he’s
buried in Llanidan cemetery.
