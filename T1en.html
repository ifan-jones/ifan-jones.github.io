<h2>Capel M.C.<br>Llithfaen</h2>
<p>The Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Llithfaen is registered as a Grade II* listed building. The present
chapel, known locally as Capel Isaf, is the fifth chapel to be built in the village for the Methodist
community. It was erected in 1905 by Griffith Jones, Morfa Nefyn, following the plans of Owen Morris
Roberts, Porthmadog. The interior of the main chapel is designed to seat around 700 people. The plaster
roof is in moulded sections and large concentric circles. The walls are plastered and painted like stone.
The wood used is pine. A gallery of 5 rows of seats is supported by corrugated iron columns. The front of
the gallery is ornate and carved, and it is striking because of its curved corners on all four sides, not to
mention the dedicated space for the then local male voice choir on the east side. There&#39;s a lower gallery
behind the pulpit, housing the organ. In 1999 it was described as a large well-preserved chapel with
their impressive carefully designed interior, built as a religious and social focus for the local community
at a time when the quarry industry was at its peak in the area.</p>
<p>The chapel cost £3081, 8 shillings and 2 pence to build. The first public service was held by Evan Roberts,
the Revivalist, on 12 December 1905. The Reverend E. Sidney Morris, lead the prayers and read from the
Bible. This happened, despite the chapel not being quite finished at the time. The painters had not
finished their work. They preached in the new chapel on 1 April 1906 and the first marriage was
administered on 15 August.</p>
<p>Hafod Ceiri is a company set up to develop Capel Isaf, Llithfaen into a multi-purpose centre for Llithfaen
and the wider local. We have signed a lease for the building for the next 99 years. Hafod Ceiri as a
company aiming to keep the unique heritage of the local area alive and to support a wide range of
people, helping to introduce them to their heritage through educational and participatory activities and
events; develop community confidence and encourage enterprise and promote employment in the area,
as well as securing a place of worship for the village of Llithfaen and the preserving an unique building.</p>
<p>The Llithfaen Regeneration Committee came together in 2012 with a view to spurring community
development in and around Llithfaen. The Committee was formed with a number of active individuals in
the village with the support of the Community Council, the Chapel Elders and it&#39;s members and local
groups. In 2013, financial support was received from the Llŷn Area of Natural Beauty and Mantell
Gwynedd. Work was commissioned to identify the community&#39;s priorities and to investigate the
opportunities offered in the area, looking at several sites in the village. One of those buildings was Capel
Isaf, and they developed recommendations and conducted a feasibility study, with a view to develop the
building. This was the beginning of Hafod Ceiri as company.</p>
