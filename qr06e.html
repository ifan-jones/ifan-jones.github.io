	<h2 class="major">The Bakery</h2>
	<p>In the 1911 census, Hugh Owens from Caernarfon ran the bakery. By 1926, Cemlyn Roberts owned it. In the 1940s, Mary Griffith (Mary Fron) moved her business and her zinc hut to run the bakery and her shop from Gwalia. The bakery remained there until the early 1970s. Adam Hughes and the other quarrymen used to pop into the bakery after work on Saturday afternoons to have round cakes, jam, and apples. <p>

<br><p>Huw Owens, the baker was a jolly and funny fellow. Later on, the Bakery was owned and run by Cemlyn Roberts, Morfudd Owen’s father (Morfudd later ran Pen-y-groes Shop, with her husband Evan Wyn). During Cemlyn Roberts’ period as baker, on a Saturday afternoon, Adam Hughes and the other quarrymen used to pop into the Bakery on the way home to buy round cakes, jam and apples. </p>
<br><p>In the 1940s, Mary Griffith, Fron came to run the Bakery in Gwalia. She even moved the contents of her zinc hut to Gwalia as well. Mary and William Griffith’s son (William being related to the family in Cambrian), Alan Jones, became famous as a sheepdog handler. The bakery remained there until the early 1970s.</p>

<br><p> Here are some funny poems by the villagers:</p>
